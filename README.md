# TiffJeff-Web

I used this: http://www.clock.co.uk/blog/a-simple-website-in-node-js-2016-edition to come up with the frame of the website. I've never used Node.js so i'm just tryna learn. 

Wedding Theme Colors - #FF6B5F, #164883


Website She Liked - http://www.ashleyjeremy.com/


Website Requests - Keep it minimal, not too busy. I'm thinking a simple, image centered site.


Pages -

  Home - just a photo
  
  The Big Day - tbh not sure what this is at all, maybe date / location info?
  
  Wedding Party - photos / descriptions
  
  Gift Registry - just links to whatever her registries are
  
  RSVP - I'm thinking embed something like a Google Form
          where people can add their names and then it goes into a Google Doc that she has?
          Alternatively we do something a little bit more complicated where there's a spreadsheet that has 
          all the people invited and we let them query it and then check themselves off or something. But I think
          the first idea might be simpler. 
          
  Our Travels - She will give us an embed link to a map she's making with the places they've been + photos.
